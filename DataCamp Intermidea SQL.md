## Chapter 1. CASE STATEMENT



Basic CASE statements

What is your favorite team?

The *European Soccer Database* contains data about 12,800 matches from 11 countries played between 2011-2015! Throughout this course, you will be shown filtered versions of the tables in this database in order to better explore their contents.

In this exercise, you will identify matches played between *FC Schalke 04* and *FC Bayern Munich*. There are 2 teams identified in each match in the `hometeam_id` and `awayteam_id` columns, available to you in the filtered `matches_germany` table. ID can join to the `team_api_id` column in the `teams_germany` table, but you cannot perform a join on both at the same time.

However, you can perform this operation using a `CASE` statement once you've identified the `team_api_id` associated with each team!

- Select the team's long name and API id from the `teams_germany` table.
- Filter the query for *FC Schalke 04* and *FC Bayern Munich* using `IN`, giving you the `team_api_IDs` needed for the next step.

```sql
SELECT
	-- Select the team long name and team API id
	team_long_name,
	team_api_id
FROM teams_germany
-- Only include FC Schalke 04 and FC Bayern Munich
WHERE team_long_name IN ('FC Schalke 04', 'FC Bayern Munich');
```

- Create a `CASE` statement that identifies whether a match in Germany included `FC Bayern Munich`, `FC Schalke 04`, or neither as the home team.
- Group the query by the `CASE` statement alias, `home_team`.

```sql
-- Identify the home team as Bayern Munich, Schalke 04, or neither
SELECT 
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 10189 THEN 'FC Schalke 04'
        WHEN hometeam_id = 9823 THEN 'FC Bayern Munich'
         ELSE 'Other' END AS home_team,
	COUNT(id) AS total_matches
FROM matches_germany
-- Group by the CASE statement alias
GROUP BY home_team;
```

Barcelona is considered one of the strongest teams in Spain's soccer league.

In this exercise, you will be creating a list of matches in the 2011/2012 season where Barcelona was the *home team*. You will do this using a `CASE` statement that compares the values of two columns to create a new group -- wins, losses, and ties.

In 3 steps, you will build a query that identifies a match's winner, identifies the identity of the opponent, and finally filters for Barcelona as the home team. Completing a query in this order will allow you to watch your results take shape with each new piece of information.

The `matches_spain` table currently contains Barcelona's matches from the 2011/2012 season, and has two key columns, `hometeam_id` and `awayteam_id`, that can be joined with the `teams_spain` table. However, you can only join `teams_spain` to one column at a time.

- Select the `date` of the match and create a `CASE` statement to identify matches as home wins, home losses, or ties.

```sql
SELECT 
	-- Select the date of the match
	date,
	-- Identify home wins, losses, or ties
	CASE WHEN home_goal > away_goal THEN 'Home win!'
         WHEN home_goal < away_goal THEN 'Home loss :(' 
         ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain;
```

- Left join the `teams_spain` table `team_api_id` column to the `matches_spain` table `awayteam_id`. This allows us to retrieve the *away* team's identity.
- Select `team_long_name` from `teams_spain` as `opponent` and complete the `CASE` statement from Step 1.

```sql
SELECT 
	m.date,
	--Select the team long name column and call it 'opponent'
	t.team_long_name AS opponent, 
	-- Complete the CASE statement with an alias
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'Home win!'
        WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Home loss :('
        ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain AS m
-- Left join teams_spain onto matches_spain
LEFT JOIN teams_spain AS t
ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id;
```

- Complete the same `CASE` statement as the previous steps.
- Filter for matches where the home team is *FC Barcelona* (id = `8634`).

```sql
SELECT 
	m.date,
	t.team_long_name AS opponent,
    -- Complete the CASE statement with an alias
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona win!'
        WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona loss :(' 
        ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome 
FROM matches_spain AS m
LEFT JOIN teams_spain AS t 
ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id
-- Filter for Barcelona as the home team
WHERE m.hometeam_id = 8634; 
```

Similar to the previous exercise, you will construct a query to determine the outcome of Barcelona's matches where they played as the ***away team***. You will learn how to combine these two queries in chapters 2 and 3.

Did their performance differ from the matches where they were the home team?

- Complete the `CASE` statement to identify Barcelona's away team games (`id = 8634`) as wins, losses, or ties.
- Left join the `teams_spain` table `team_api_id` column on the `matches_spain` table `hometeam_id` column. This retrieves the identity of the *home team* opponent.
- Filter the query to only include matches where Barcelona was the *away* team.

```sql
-- Select matches where Barcelona was the away team
SELECT  
	m.date,
	t.team_long_name AS opponent,
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona win!'
         WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona loss :(' 
        ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain AS m
-- Join teams_spain to matches_spain
LEFT JOIN teams_spain AS t 
ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id
WHERE m.awayteam_id = 8634;
```

Barcelona and Real Madrid have been rival teams for more than 80 years. Matches between these two teams are given the name *El Clásico* (The Classic). In this exercise, you will query a list of matches played between these two rivals.

You will notice in Step 2 that when you have multiple logical conditions in a `CASE` statement, you may quickly end up with a large number of `WHEN` clauses to logically test every outcome you are interested in. It's important to make sure you don't accidentally exclude key information in your `ELSE` clause.

In this exercise, you will retrieve information about matches played between **Barcelona** (id = `8634`) and **Real Madrid** (id = `8633`). Note that the query you are provided with already identifies the *Clásico* matches using a filter in the `WHERE` clause.

- Complete the first `CASE` statement, identifying Barcelona or Real Madrid as the home team using the `hometeam_id` column.
- Complete the second `CASE` statement in the same way, using `awayteam_id`.

```sql
SELECT 
	date,
	-- Identify the home team as Barcelona or Real Madrid
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' 
        ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END AS home,
    -- Identify the away team as Barcelona or Real Madrid
	CASE WHEN  awayteam_id= 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' 
        ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END AS away
FROM matches_spain
WHERE (awayteam_id = 8634 OR hometeam_id = 8634)
      AND (awayteam_id = 8633 OR hometeam_id = 8633);
```

- Construct the final `CASE` statement identifying who won each match. Note there are 3 possible outcomes, but 5 conditions that you need to identify.
- Fill in the logical operators to identify Barcelona or Real Madrid as the winner.

```sql
SELECT 
	date,
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' 
         ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END as home,
	CASE WHEN awayteam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' 
         ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END as away,
	-- Identify all possible match outcomes
	CASE WHEN home_goal > away_goal AND hometeam_id = 8634 THEN 'Barcelona win!'
        WHEN home_goal > away_goal AND hometeam_id = 8633 THEN 'Real Madrid win!'
        WHEN home_goal < away_goal AND awayteam_id = 8634 THEN 'Barcelona win!'
        WHEN home_goal < away_goal AND awayteam_id = 8633 THEN 'Real Madrid win!'
        ELSE 'Tie!' END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain
WHERE (awayteam_id = 8634 OR hometeam_id = 8634)
      AND (awayteam_id = 8633 OR hometeam_id = 8633);
```

Let's generate a list of matches won by Italy's *Bologna* team! There are quite a few additional teams in the two tables, so a key part of generating a usable query will be using your `CASE` statement as a filter in the `WHERE` clause.

`CASE` statements allow you to categorize data that you're interested in -- and exclude data you're not interested in. In order to do this, you can use a `CASE` statement as a filter in the `WHERE` statement to remove output you don't want to see.

Here is how you might set that up:

```
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE 
    CASE WHEN a > 5 THEN 'Keep'
         WHEN a <= 5 THEN 'Exclude' END = 'Keep';
```

In essence, you can use the `CASE` statement as a filtering column like any other column in your database. The only difference is that you *don't* alias the statement in `WHERE`.

- Identify `Bologna`'s team ID listed in the `teams_italy` table by selecting the `team_long_name` and `team_api_id`.

```sql
-- Select team_long_name and team_api_id from team
SELECT
	team_long_name,
	team_api_id
FROM teams_Italy
-- Filter for team name
WHERE team_long_name = 'Bologna';
```

- Select the `season` and `date` that a match was played.
- Complete the `CASE` statement so that only Bologna's home and away wins are identified.

```sql
-- Select the season and date columns
SELECT 
	season,
	date,
    -- Identify when Bologna won a match
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 9857 AND home_goal > away_goal THEN 'Bologna Win'
		WHEN awayteam_id = 9857 AND away_goal > home_goal THEN 'Bologna Win' 
		END AS outcome
FROM matches_italy;
```

- Select the `home_goal` and `away_goal` for each match.
- Use the `CASE` statement in the `WHERE` clause to filter all `NULL` values generated by the statement in the previous step.

```sql
-- Select the season, date, home_goal, and away_goal columns
SELECT 
	season,
    date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal
FROM matches_italy
WHERE 
-- Exclude games not won by Bologna
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 9857 AND home_goal > away_goal THEN 'Bologna Win'
		 WHEN awayteam_id = 9857 AND away_goal > home_goal THEN 'Bologna Win' 
		 END IS NOT NULL;
```
